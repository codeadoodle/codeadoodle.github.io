Bring agility, integrative thinking and collaborative mindset to intuit trends, latent needs, and anticipate future. Proficient in design thinking, data visualisation and rapid prototyping. Web 1.0 &amp; Information Studies (2001 - 2006) I started my career as Web Designer at CrimsonLogic (back when it was known as Singapore Network Services). I was involved in in-house Corporate and Intranet portals as well as Trade and Logistic and Legal related products such as TradeNet, TradePallette, TradeXChange, EFS, Lawnet and AsianConnect. As context, Macromedia Dreamweaver and spacer.gif were the way we did UI design. In 2003, CSS Zen Garden appeared - inspiring designers to adopt cleaner HTML based on Web Standard. Combining CSS and JSP Tag Library, we developed “Design System” to promote consistent and reusable user interface. Macromedia Flash and ActionScript were the major software we worked to build many animated intros and interactive demos. Followed with “Rich Internet Application” and “Adobe Air” concept to bring the best of desktop and web applications. We took ambitious undertaking to build CRM RIA for our in-house call center. I learned the architectural needs and challenges to build interactive enterprise applications. I was also involved in the TrustSg project, a nation-wide trust mark initiative by the National Trust Council to build confidence in e-commerce transactions especially in the area of privacy and security with motion and dynamically generated graphics as watermark. With growing awareness of application of design beyond aesthetic and emergence of Social Web - I took part time postgraduate courses on Information Studies to further my skills on Human Computer Interaction (HCI) as well as pick up methods, tools and frameworks to manage, analyze and derive insights from traditional as well as digital information assets. Elearning and Gamification (2006 - 2008) A recruiter introduced me to ICUS, a bespoke provider of customized eLearning services and solutions for corporate education. There I was involved in many interactive contents and games designed to enhance working professionals’ learning experience in Aviation, Banking and Consulting. I had the opportunity to learn from our instructional designers on adult learning theory and models such as ADDIE model and Bloom’s taxonomy to bring clarity, motivation and engagement. I appreciate the camaraderie, needs and impact of effective Project Management in managing scope, schedule and cost. The company was acquired by Academee in 2007 and acquired by Oliver Wyman subsequently in April 2008. Web 2.0, Corporate R&amp;D and Hackathons (2008 - 2016) From the “SME” environment, I received an offer to join the Technology Office department in ST Electronics Info-Software Systems - notably one of the major ICT players in Singapore. This is where I was exposed to the Corporate R&amp;D role in conceptualizing and envisioning new innovations for internal and external customers. Some of the projects that were publicly disclosed are iSAAC for Airport Operations which was showcased during Singapore Airshow 2010 and SCDF Advanced C3 Emergency System (ACES) commissioned in late Nov 2013. I expanded my role beyond design into project and product management with close collaboration with engineering and business teams on requirements, design, roadmap, execution, funding and KPI monitoring. I also took up an additional role as CTO Secretary administering a broad variety of tasks with Senior Executives across ST Electronics subsidiaries. This requires me to be adept in communication and coordination of activities to support the CTO’s agenda. During this period, User Experience design started to gain wider recognition with the local community UXSG established in 2012 and the General Assembly campus arrived in Singapore in 2015. We start looking at the complementary roles of User Research and User Centered Design with Agile development practice for innovation. Aside from my professional work, I got to know and participated in several “civic” hackathons organized by Urban Prototyping (UP) Singapore since 2014. This is a community where people from the public, private and people sectors come together to tackle the wide variety of socio-economic and environmental challenges such as aging, health, tourism and the maritime port. Through participation in those hackathons, I found inspiration and motivation for making positive social changes by applying design thinking, prototyping, business models and value proposition design skills. This is how I decided to join the next company. Social Value Creation R&amp;D (2016 - Now) After 8 years, I joined NEC Laboratories Singapore (NLS) - established in 2013 as one of the R &amp; D global labs of NEC Corporation. Since its founding in 1899, NEC has established a rich history of innovations from sea to outer space. We define our mission to create social values for society and promote a more sustainable world. I became the first NLS member with a design background and experience. There I established User Experience Design Practice. We set up an Advanced Center for Experimentation in 2017 as a “living lab” for co-creation of innovative solutions with customers and partners. I had the opportunity to work across various domains and topics such as Public Safety, Transport Mobility, Tourism, Hospitality and Healthcare. We applied early R&amp;D technologies for Proof-of-Concepts and Open Innovation projects. This includes Video Analytics and Recognition (Face, Behavior, Gaze, Pose, Vehicle) technology as well as Natural Language Processing and Recommendation System. I’m currently leading Business Design initiative, in-charge of continuously looking at accelerating time-to-market and expanding our collaborative research activities.
