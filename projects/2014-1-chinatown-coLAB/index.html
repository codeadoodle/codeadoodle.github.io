Being a multi-racial and multi-cultural society since its founding, Singapore Chinatown is not the exclusive sphere of the ethnic Chinese but also includes Indians and Muslims with their Temples, Mosques, and Churches found alongside each other.</p><p>Yet, despite efforts to preserve the history and culture of Singapore Chinatown through the conservation of buildings, culture, cuisines, festivals, and place of worships, it is often considered as touristy and artificial. As such, Chinatown coLAB 2014 is organized to seek ideas which would address following challenges:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Challenge 1: Collecting Stories:</strong> <em>How might we use technology to better collect, document and visualize often hidden data and community stories that help us better understand the Chinatown story?</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Challenge 2: Telling Stories:</strong> <em>How might we use technology to offer new Chinatown experience that will engage and help visitor to make accessible the stories of Chinatown, navigate and find what they want; or even better, what they didn’t know existed to enhance their enjoyment?</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Challenge 3: Connecting Chinatown Businesses with Visitors:</strong> <em>How might we use technology to help Chinatown businesses do to better connect with visitors/customers?</em></p></li></ul><h3 id=context-discovery>Context Discovery</h3><div class=BannerContainer style=height:500px><div class="BannerImage BannerImage--background" style=background-image:url(/assets/images/2014/1/chinatown-2.jpg)></div></div><p>Our team had great time learning about Chinatown story from local Chinatown community member such as Victor Yue, Blogger bullockcartwater as well as mentors from NUS Enterprise and Kreta Ayer Community. The opportunity interacting with local community members is really inspiring. We met may passionate members who are willing to volunteer their time and share their Chinatown story to visitors.</p><h3 id=idea-today-tomorrow>Idea: Today Tomorrow</h3><p><em>Connect visitors and local Chinatown community of volunteers in real-time</em></p><div class=BannerContainer style=height:350px><div class="BannerImage BannerImage--background" style=background-image:url(/assets/images/2014/1/screenshots-app.png)></div></div><div class=BannerContainer style=height:350px><div class="BannerImage BannerImage--background" style=background-image:url(/assets/images/2014/1/screenshots-app2.png)></div></div><div class=BannerContainer style=height:350px><div class="BannerImage BannerImage--background" style=background-image:url(/assets/images/2014/1/screenshots-app3.png)></div></div><p>We began to realize that connecting these volunteers and visitors who are curious, interested or care to know more about Chinatown heritage is not an easy tasks, due to various factors such as location, time, and interest.</p><p>Our solution aims to make Volunteer and Visitors meetup planning and connection simple, easy and spontaneous. One way to achieve this is through a mobile app with real-time list of currently available volunteers and allowing meetup appointment to either today or tomorrow. This results in better control and flexibility for both visitor and volunteers to manage their appointments according to their current availability.</p><p>In addition, our app allows visitor to leave feedback (or token of appreciation) to respective volunteer, which would bring a more positive, pleasant and rewarding experience.</p><div class=BannerContainer style=height:500px><div class="BannerImage BannerImage--background" style=background-image:url(/assets/images/2014/1/chinatown-3.jpg)></div></div><h3 id=result>Result</h3><div class=BannerContainer style=height:500px><div class="BannerImage BannerImage--background" style=background-image:url(/assets/images/2014/1/chinatown-5.jpg)></div></div><p>Our application was awarded “2nd Runner Up” prize.</p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/93330438?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width=640 height=360 frameborder=0 webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/92914172?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width=640 height=360 frameborder=0 webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Presentation and Highlight Reel from <a href=http://www.upsingapore.com/events/chinatown-colab/ >UP Singapore</a>.</p></div></div><div class=wrapper><div class=custom-divider></div><div class=paginator-list><script>document.body.onkeyup=function(o){"37"==o.keyCode&&(window.location="/projects/2010-2-singaporeairshow/"),"39"==o.keyCode&&(window.location="/projects/2014-2-enabling-community-coLAB/")}</script></div><div class=paginator-project><div class=paginator-project-prev><a href=/projects/2010-2-singaporeairshow/ class="prev PaginatorLinkButton">&lArr; Singapore Airshow 2010</a></div><div class=paginator-project-next><a href=/projects/2014-2-enabling-community-coLAB/ class="nxt PaginatorLinkButton">Enabling Community coLAB 2014 &rArr;</a></div></div></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=wrapper><div class=footer-heading>&nbsp;</div><div class=footer-col-wrapper><div class="footer-col footer-col-1"><ul class=contact-list><li>Albert Hardy</li><li><a href=mailto:albert@tanutama.com>albert@tanutama.com</a></li></ul><ul class=social-media-list><li><a rel=me href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/alberthardy title=alberthardy><svg class="svg-icon grey"><use xlink:href=/assets/minima-social-icons.svg#linkedin></use></svg></a></li><li><a rel=me href=https://twitter.com/alberthardy title=alberthardy><svg class="svg-icon grey"><use xlink:href=/assets/minima-social-icons.svg#twitter></use></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="footer-col footer-col-2"><ul class=social-media-list></ul></div><div class="footer-col footer-col-3"><p>Designer, Improviser and Researcher.
