Collaborating with stakeholders, I translate ideas into tangible solutions by aligning the potential of technologies and the realities of business. Web 1.0 &amp; Information Studies (2001 - 2006) I earned my degree in Computer Engineer and embarked on my professional journey as a Web Designer at Singapore Network Services (Now CrimsonLogic). In this role, I contributed to the design of Corporate Intranet and Internet products related to Legal, Trade and Logistics sectors such as TradeNet, TradePallette, TradeXChange, EFS, Lawnet, and AsianConnect. Within our team, we created animated intros and interactive demos utilizing Macromedia Flash and ActionScript. Embracing “Rich Internet Application” concept and “Adobe Air” technology, we aimed to create breakthrough products that integrate the strengths of desktop and online web. My understanding of architectural requirements deepened when our team ambitiously undertook the development of a CRM RIA for an in-house call center. I involved in the TrustSG project, a nationwide digital trust mark initiative by the National Trust Council. This initiative aimed to instill confidence in e-commerce transactions through motion and dynamically generated watermarks. Through close collaboration with administrators and the technical team, my interest in systems operations grew, leading me to obtain Microsoft Certification as a System Administrator for Windows Server 2003. Simultaneously, as the awareness of design’s broader applications and the rise of the Social Web unfolded, I pursued part-time Postgraduate on Information Studies. This endeavor aimed to enhance my skills in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and traditional as well as digital information asset management. Elearning and Gamification (2006 - 2008) I became a part of ICUS, a leading corporate eLearning service provider, where my focus was on crafting interactive content and games tailored to enrich the learning journey of Aviation, Banking, and Consulting professionals. During my time at ICUS, I gained valuable insights from instructional designers, adopting adult learning principles through the application of the ADDIE model and Bloom’s taxonomy. This approach aimed to enhance clarity, motivation, and engagement in the learning materials we developed. The company’s robust project management and collaborative team culture enabled us to establish strong connections with our clients. In 2007, ICUS was acquired by the UK-based Academee, and later, in April 2008, by Oliver Wyman, marking a significant milestone in the company’s evolution. Web 2.0, Corporate R&amp;D and Hackathons (2008 - 2016) I transitioned to the Technology Office department at ST Electronics Info-Software Systems (now ST Engineering), a prominent ICT player in Singapore. This marked my entry into the Corporate R&amp;D realm, where I engaged in conceptualizing and envisioning innovative solutions for both internal and external clients. Notable projects that received public attention include iSAAC for Airport Operations, showcased during the Singapore Airshow 2010, and the SCDF Advanced C3 Emergency System (ACES), commissioned in late November 2013. My role evolved beyond design, encompassing project and product management. I closely collaborated with engineering and business teams, overseeing aspects such as requirements, design, roadmap planning, execution, funding, and KPI monitoring. This period witnessed the growing recognition of User Experience design, prompting the integration of User-Centered Design with Agile development practices—an unconventional approach in the context of the prevailing project engineering culture. In addition to my primary responsibilities, I took on the role of CTO Secretary, handling diverse tasks in support of the CTO’s agenda across various ST Electronics subsidiaries. This required effective communication and coordination with senior management. Outside of my professional endeavors, I became involved in “community hackathons” organized by Urban Prototyping (UP) Singapore since 2014. These events provided a platform for individuals from the public, private, and people sectors to collaborate on addressing socio-economic and environmental challenges such as aging, health, tourism, and maritime port activities. Participating in these hackathons was a roller coaster experience with numerous highs and lows—from pitching ideas to realizing them. The process fueled my inspiration and motivation to drive positive social change through the application of design thinking, prototyping, business models, and value proposition design. The desire to make a meaningful social impact became a pivotal factor in my decision to transition to my next professional endeavor. Social Value Creation R&amp;D (2016 - Now) After eight years, I made the decision to join NEC Laboratories Singapore (NLS), established in 2013 as one of the global R&amp;D labs of NEC Corporation. With a legacy dating back to 1899, NEC has consistently pioneered innovations from the depths of the sea to the outer reaches of space, driven by a commitment to creating societal value and fostering a more sustainable world. Being the first NLS member with a design background, I played a pivotal role in introducing and establishing the User Experience Design Practice. In 2017, we inaugurated the Advanced Center for Experimentation, serving as a dynamic “living lab” for collaboratively creating innovative solutions with our customers and partners. Our core mission is to leverage early R&amp;D technologies for Proof-of-Concepts and Open Innovation initiatives. These technologies cover a broad spectrum of Video Analytics and Recognition AI (including Face, Behavior, Gaze, Pose, Vehicle, and more), alongside Recommendation Systems and Natural Language Processing. My experience extends across various domains, including Public Safety, Transport Mobility, Tourism, Hospitality, and Healthcare. At present, I lead Business Design initiatives, spearheading the exploration of new platforms, products, and services. In this capacity, I leverage design expertise to expand our collaborative research endeavors and hasten time-to-market, contributing to the advancement of our mission.
