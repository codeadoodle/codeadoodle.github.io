We also explore the conditions and behavioral habits that facilitate the space for asking better questions, and develop the ability to find, frame, and solve challenges. By learning how to facilitate productive inquiry with a question-based mindset, we can uncover new insights and opportunities for innovation. There are 6 modules: MODULE 1 APPRECIATING THE POWER OF CATALYTIC QUESTIONS Recognize how better answers are a result of asking better questions and explore how to apply a question-based approach to challenges in personal and professional life.
