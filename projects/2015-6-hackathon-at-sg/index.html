The competition is jointly organized by Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore and IT Standards Committee on 25-26 July‬ to tackle urban challenges impacting Singapore and participate in Smart Nation building efforts.</p><p>As one of the challenge sponsors, Singapore Land Authority (SLA) is seeking a geospatial-enabled platform or application to promote volunteerism and caring communities through sharing of geo-data. Driven by this needs, we are looking to address following questions:</p><ul><li>How might we enable more people participate in community volunteerism?</li><li>How might we enable people in need to get timely and responsive help?</li></ul><h3 id=idea-project-grabhelp>Idea: Project GrabHelp</h3><p><em>Universal Community Volunteerism</em></p><div class=BannerContainer style=height:350px><div class="BannerImage BannerImage--background" style=background-image:url(/assets/images/2015/6/screenshots-app.png)></div></div><div class=BannerContainer style=height:350px><div class="BannerImage BannerImage--background" style=background-image:url(/assets/images/2015/6/screenshots-app2.png)></div></div><div class=BannerContainer style=height:400px><div class="BannerImage BannerImage--background" style=background-image:url(/assets/images/2015/6/hack-2.JPG)></div></div><p>Using SMS as Communication Platform, GrabHelp locates and connects those who needs help with nearby community of volunteers in near real-time. We simplify the process of requesting help via SMS just by using name, needs and location keyword. GrabHelp will then find available and notify nearby volunteers for acknowledgement.
