Designing effective trigger is important because without an appropriate trigger, behavior will not occur even if both motivation and ability are high. From the neuroscience perspective, creating new behaviors can be done by rewiring the brain. This can be accomplished via repetition and to associate with positive emotions (e.g. positive reinforcement by celebrating small wins) <sup id=fnref:neuroscience role=doc-noteref><a href=#fn:neuroscience class=footnote rel=footnote>2</a></sup> - which is also related to Pavlovian / Classical conditioned learning to bring reflexive behavior <sup id=fnref:pavlov role=doc-noteref><a href=#fn:pavlov class=footnote rel=footnote>3</a></sup>.</p><p>The ringing sound of the bell which has been associated with a form of celebration inspire us to explore its potential. We noted such practices of using sound and frequencies to impact the physical and emotional health of the body is not new. It has been argued that sound can have physiological effects because its vibrations are not merely heard but also felt which may lower heart rate variability, relax brain wave patterns and reduce respiratory rates<sup id=fnref:bell role=doc-noteref><a href=#fn:bell class=footnote rel=footnote>4</a></sup>. At the sametime, there notable interest in “fidgeting” - a repetitive sensory stimulation with an object for therapeutic purposes.</p><p>Based on those findings, we conceptualise “Auditory Association Trigger” that will enhance recall, evokes emotion and reinforce formation of healthier habits for the “War on Diabetes”.</p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/224298429?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width=640 height=360 frameborder=0 webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/225524363?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width=640 height=360 frameborder=0 webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Pitch Preview and Highlight Reel from <a href=http://www.upsingapore.com/events/war-on-diabetes-designathon/#ideas>UP Singapore</a>.</p><h2 id=reference>Reference</h2><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><ol><li id=fn:fogg role=doc-endnote><p><a href=https://behaviormodel.org/ >Fogg Behavior Model</a> <a href=#fnref:fogg class=reversefootnote role=doc-backlink>&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=fn:neuroscience role=doc-endnote><p><a href=https://healthtransformer.co/the-neuroscience-of-behavior-change-bcb567fa83c1>Neurosience of Behavior Change</a> <a href=#fnref:neuroscience class=reversefootnote role=doc-backlink>&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=fn:pavlov role=doc-endnote><p><a href=https://healthypsych.com/how-to-change-behavior-a-theoretical-overview/ >How to change behavior</a> <a href=#fnref:pavlov class=reversefootnote role=doc-backlink>&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=fn:bell role=doc-endnote><p><a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/24/fashion/thursdaystyles/whats-the-buzz-sound-therapy.html>Sound Therapy</a> <a href=#fnref:bell class=reversefootnote role=doc-backlink>&#8617;</a></p></li></ol></div></div></div><div class=wrapper><div class=custom-divider></div><div class=paginator-list><script>document.body.onkeyup=function(o){"37"==o.keyCode&&(window.location="/projects/2017-2-moe-buildathon/"),"39"==o.keyCode&&(window.location="/projects/2017-4-sia-app-challenge/")}</script></div><div class=paginator-project><div class=paginator-project-prev><a href=/projects/2017-2-moe-buildathon/ class="prev PaginatorLinkButton">&lArr; MOE Learning Buildathon</a></div><div class=paginator-project-next><a href=/projects/2017-4-sia-app-challenge/ class="nxt PaginatorLinkButton">SIA App Challenge &rArr;</a></div></div></div></article></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=wrapper><div class=footer-heading>&nbsp;</div><div class=footer-col-wrapper><div class="footer-col footer-col-1"><ul class=contact-list><li>Albert Hardy</li><li><a href=mailto:albert@tanutama.com>albert@tanutama.com</a></li></ul><ul class=social-media-list><li><a rel=me href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/alberthardy title=alberthardy><svg class="svg-icon grey"><use xlink:href=/assets/minima-social-icons.svg#linkedin></use></svg></a></li><li><a rel=me href=https://twitter.com/alberthardy title=alberthardy><svg class="svg-icon grey"><use xlink:href=/assets/minima-social-icons.svg#twitter></use></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="footer-col footer-col-2"><ul class=social-media-list></ul></div><div class="footer-col footer-col-3"><p>Designer, Improviser and Researcher.
